          Back at the beginning of the 20th century Detroit, also referred to by many as the “Motor City”,
          has vastly benefited from the auto industry expansion. As a result, by 1950 the city of Detroit
          has become the fourth largest city in the US with nearly 1.85 million residents. Throughout the late 1960’s,
          due to a push for automation and a decentralization of production, Detroit's decline started.
          Over time the city has gone through massive population decrease to the level of under 700K
          residents in 2015. These changes resulted in the elimination of large amount of jobs. As a result,
          more and more residents moved out of the city. Over the past few years, Detroit’s populations
          continued to decline. This consistent trend resulted in many abandoned structures throughout the city.
          These structures have become an urban and social issue, affecting neighborhoods’ sense of community and safety.
          In 2013 the city of Detroit has been granted $250 million in federal aid to demolish structures.

          In the same time, many Detroiters have been evicted from their homes. In 2007 the city's evictions
          reached a peak of 13,139. In 2016 the number of evictions in Wayne county decreased to 7,009.
          While the city of Detroit experienced overall decrease in housing evictions, each year thousands
          of families are still uprooted from their communities.

          <p>
          In this project I argue that while tenants should be kept responsible for paying rent
          and keeping their lease agreements, a targeted assistance from the city could impact
          families on the cusp of eviction. Furthermore, as the demand for houses is lower than the supply,
          evicted houses in Detroit are likely to stay inhabited. In some cases these structures will deteriorate
          to a level of hazardous conditions, and will eventually get demolished.

          Based on data from 2014 to 2019
          the average price for a residential demolition in Detroit is $17,323. Furthermore, in October 2019
          the average rent in Detroit was $1,075 per month. This means that, on average, each housing demolition
          can be substituted with 16 months of rent assistance. Implementing housing assistance policy for
          preventing housing evictions in Detroit will be a win-win situation for both the city and for individual
          households. I created data visualizations to guide policy makers and community members on specific
          areas that could be targeted for policy interventions.

          Detroit Residential Units Surplus Map:

          This is a census block level map of Detroits’ evictions and residential vacancies in 2016.
          The pink-orange-red graduated polygons represent the number of evictions which took place
          in Detroit in 2016. Pink implies that no evictions occurred in this census tract. In contrast,
          a red polygon is an indication that a large number of evictions took place in this census block.
          In addition, white patterned fillings on top of the eviction layer represents the Residential
          Units Surplus (RUS). The RUS score was calculated by subtracting the number of evictions from
          the total number of vacancies in each census block in 2016. The denser the white filling gets, the larger
          the surplus is. For example, the dense-dotted white filed polygons are an indication for
          many more vacancies than evicted homes in 2016. In contrast, the white outlined polygons
          have a negative housing surplus. Meaning that this census block has less vacancies
          than the total number of evicted families. The darker (red or orange) polygons with a white
          dotted pattern are areas where many evictions could have been potentially avoided in 2016.

          2016 Detorit Eviction & Vacancy Rates Per Census Block:
        </p>

        <p>

          This visualization displays the rates of evictions and vacancies (Y axis) for each individual
          census block in Detroit (X axis) in 2016. The pink line is the rate of vacancies. The purple
          line is the rate of evictions in 2016. In most census blocks the rate of vacancies was
          higher than the rate of evictions. This implies that there were many census blocks which
          had low demand for housing. However, many of these census blocks still suffered from evictions.
          In areas where both lines meet, the rate of both evictions and vacancies were the same for
          the particular census block.
