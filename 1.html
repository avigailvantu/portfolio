          <p>
            In recent decades, Detroit has greatly suffered from population shrinkage and,
            consequently, many housing vacancies. This has had a profound impact on the public
            health and quality of life in the city’s neighborhoods. In 2014, Detroit launched
            a program to use public funding to demolish vacant houses and has since demolished
            >14,000 properties. The assumption behind this policy, is that houses surrounding
            demolition sites are likely to see decreases in crime and increases property value
            (estimated 4%). At the same time, many Detroiters have raised concerns that the
            implementation of this plan is being carried out too hastily; without proper
            consideration for how to identify and safely demolish homes built with hazardous
            materials and without adequate care for the preservation of Detroit’s distinct
            character and history. Furthermore, the demolition efforts require substantial
            public funding, which could be designated for improving homes rather than
            tearing them down.

            In this hands-on workshop I co-led with
            <a href="http://eitanakman.com/">
              Eitan Akman
            </a>
            , participants from the
            urban planning and urban design fields had the opportunity to reduce data maps
            and quantify how demolition policies have impacted Detroit’s public spaces and
            its perception. Through data visualizations and analysis of important urban
            variables in Detroit neighborhoods, participants gained an interesting
            perspective on some of the complex questions surrounding Detroit’s
            demolition program.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this workshop, held at the Public X Design conference in Detroit,
            we gave participants personalized <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebooks</a>
            so they could perform their own data analysis in their web browsers using Python code.
            The workshop was a walk-through of Python basics as well
            as an introduction to open data analysis and visualizations. The
            workshop focused on attempting to understand the impact of
            the housing demolition policy in Detroit by accounting for demolitions,
            crime, and real-estate prices in all of Detroit’s neighborhoods.

            If you would likg to learn more about our workshop, you can check out the full notebook which is
            available on
            <a href="https://github.com/avigailvantu/Open-Demolitions/blob/master/data:analysis/combined_notebook.ipynb">
              Github
            </a>.
            Throughout the workshop we learned how to compare different geographical
            units, such as neighborhoods, by stratifying and working with the percentage
            changes instead of absolute numbers. Our three main datasets were: demolitions
            in Detroit from 2014-2018, real estate prices changes between 2013 and 2017,
            and crime changes between 2013 and 2017.
          </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusions</h2>
          <a href="#">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/crime_demo.jpg" alt="">
          </a>

          <p>
            First we analyzed the neighborhoods where the biggest number of
            demolitions occurred taking note of the variation in pricing among the different
            demolition contracts. Later we looked into how the trends in demolitions
            match real estate and crime trends throughout the period of time
            when the policy was widely implemented. We found that although
            crime rates have overall declined from 2013 to 2017, they do not
            seem to align with the demolition trends among Detroits neighborhoods.
            As for real estate trends, it seems like there is a negative relationship
            between demolition and real estate percentage change. Meaning that low
            (standardized) demolitions in a certain neighborhood may be a predictor
            of a spike in real estate prices between 2013 to 2017 studies period.

          <p>
            * It is important to note that we didn’t investigate causation between
            these two variables, and that there may be other reasons for this
            reversed relationship. For example, areas with low numbers of demolitions
            may be an indication of higher socio-economic populations, or more
            central areas, with overall more demand for housing.
